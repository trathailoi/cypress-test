Bosley has been a full-time hair restoration practice since 1974\u2014it\u2019s all we do.<\/p>\r\n<p>We think the facts speak for themselves:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bosley has performed more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/hair-transplant\/\" data-gc-link=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/hair-transplant\/\">hair transplants<\/a> than any other medical group in the world.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>We\u2019ve restored hair for patients from all 50 states and more than 70 foreign countries.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>We\u2019ve pioneered major advancements in the field of hair transplantation over the last 40 years.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Every Bosley physician is required to be actively licensed in the state in which they practice along with being a member of one or more professional associations. Before joining Bosley, all of our physicians have had years of training and experience in their field. If you are interested in seeing a particular Bosley physician, you can find a summary of their professional training and background by searching our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/hair-transplant\/doctors\/\">Doctors page<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bosley\u2019s advanced hair transplant procedures and our doctors\u2019 artistic abilities lead to recreated hairlines and hair growth that looks as natural as your original hair. Our follicular-unit techniques result in hair restoration so natural that most people can\u2019t tell which hairs are transplanted and which are native. (You can even watch a video of people trying to tell the difference if you order our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/about\/get-info-kit\/\">Info Kit<\/a>)<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>Can women get a hair transplant? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                <p>Of course!

Bosley hair restorations utilize cutting-edge techniques based on recent research, leading to restorations that go unnoticed because they are so natural looking.<\/p>\r\n<p>Modern research in hair growth discovered that scalp hairs grow in small groupings called follicular units. Each unit contains between one and four hairs per unit. We duplicate that grouping by randomly dispersing hair units like nature does.<\/p>\r\n<p>With our 30 years of experience in the artistry of hair restoration, we have refined these micro-technologies to the point where medical doctors have difficulty identifying which hairs are the original, non-transplanted follicles and which have been transplanted.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>Can I speak with someone who got their transplant through Bosley? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                <p>In addition to reviewing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/hair-transplant\/results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-gc-link=\"https:\/\/www.bosley.com\/hair-transplant\/results\/\">photos and testimonies<\/a> shared by Bosley Patients, you can also email Bosley patients to ask about their experiences with hair transplantation.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you\u2019d like, we can also arrange for you to meet or talk to a patient who has had hair restoration work done.

If you have a pre-existing medical condition, please tell your Senior Counselor at the time of your consultation. For your convenience, we have listed responses for some of the most frequently conditions and medications:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>COUMADIN:<\/strong> If you are taking Coumadin, you will need to be off Coumadin for a week prior to your hair restoration procedure. When you have a consultation, your Bosley physician may require an okay from your physician.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>DIABETES: <\/strong>We have performed many hundreds of successful hair transplant procedures for patients with diabetes. However, to determine possible candidacy for hair restoration, you will first need to have a consultation with one of our physicians. Your Bosley physician may require an okay from your diabetes physician to confirm that your diabetes is under good control.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>INTRAVENOUS SEDATION: <\/strong>At Bosley, intravenous sedation is virtually never used for hair restoration procedures. Instead, patients are administered local anesthesia and are able to relax and watch a video, stretch or use the restroom at any time during the procedure. If you would like additional sedation or relaxation, you may request it from your Bosley physician who will be pleased to order it for you.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>KIDNEY TRANSPLANT: <\/strong>For various medical reasons, a hair restoration procedure cannot be done prior to a pending kidney transplant. However, once a kidney transplant procedure is completed and has healed, your Bosley physician can determine if it is feasible for you to have a hair transplant procedure.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>LUPUS (Erythematosus) \u2013 LE<\/strong>: Our physicians at Bosley believe that, in many cases, it is not a good idea to transplant hair into an area where the hair loss caused by LE has occurred. After hair has been transplanted into such an area, the LE process (which caused the hair loss) could recur. However, in some cases (when LE has been inactive for many years) it is feasible to do hair transplants. Your Bosley physician will determine this.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>Won\u2019t my transplanted hair just fall out like my old hair? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                <p>For the vast majority of patients, virtually all transplanted hair lasts a lifetime.

Fibrosis is the skin\u2019s natural way of healing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the skill of our experienced hair transplant physicians, the healing sites in the transplanted areas are usually so small that scarring is virtually undetectable, and the donor site scar is covered by your existing hair.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>Do hair transplantation procedures hurt? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                <p>It's difficult to evaluate a patient\u2019s degree of pain or discomfort during or after a procedure - as it varies from one patient to another. However, all patients are administered local anesthetics and other pain medications during the procedure, and a Bosley physician may supply medication to use after the procedure if needed. However, many of our patients find that they do not need to take any medication after their hair transplant.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>Does it really matter where you have a hair transplant done? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                <p>Yes. Like any medical procedure, it does matter.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bosley can\u2019t speak to others' work because we don\u2019t know the exact protocols and techniques that were used. But the reality is that every physician doesn\u2019t have the skill or training to achieve natural looking results.<\/p>\r\n<p>We can, however, talk about Bosley\u2019s hair transplant procedure and the artistry that emphasizes the natural variations in the texture and color of hair, the angles and directions of hair growth, and the size and shape of grafts.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n                <div class=\"item-overview-faq py-15 border-b-1 border-solid cursor-pointer lg:py-17\">\n            <div class=\"title-of last-mb-none relative\">\n                <div class=\"close-faq absolute right-0 top-3\">\n                    <span class=\"span-v1\"><\/span>\n                    <span class=\"span-v2\"><\/span>\n                <\/div>\n                <p>How many procedures will I have to undergo? <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"content-of last-mb-none content\">\n                The number of procedures you'll need depends on your goals and your degree of hair loss.
